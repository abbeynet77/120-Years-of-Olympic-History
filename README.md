## 25 Questions Exploratory Data Analysis withÂ R

The dataset used in this project was downloaded from kaggle [120 years of Olympic history](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?datasetId=31029)

The Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016 are included in this dataset. The dataset contains two files: the athletes file and the region file.

We are going to answer **25 questions** in our exploratory data analysis using the R programming language in R Studio.

Some of these questions were inspired with what [techTFQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XruOBp7yPXU) did using SQL. I decided to use R programming to answer the questions and added a few other questions.

I have written code for each question to be self-explanatory, that even if you are not an R user, you can decipher what each line of code is doing with the help of the results output, in as much you have familiarized yourself with the dataset used in this project.
